        ### About this "Issues"
        The Issues in this repository are purely used as a bug tracker. Please post questions, requests, and suggestions on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/DDQqxkK7s6). Please note that posts other than bug reports posted on this Issues are often ignored and closed as is.
        ### About Bug Reports
        - Bug reports should be written in English. If, like me, English is not your first language and you are not confident in your English skills, we recommend using tools such as Google Translate, Deepl Translate, ChatGPT, etc. for translation.
        - Unless it is a very simple bug (such as the game not starting when installed), please describe the bug in detail. In particular, attaching an error log is very effective. Even if you just say "This feature doesn't work" without an error log, there is not much I can do.
        - Before reporting a bug, please make sure that the bug is really caused by this mod. Please enable only this mod (if additional content added by other mods is involved, enable that mod too) and confirm that the bug occurs. There are often cases where "Mod A" added causes "Mod B" to not work, but the cause was "Mod C".
